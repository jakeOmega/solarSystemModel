# solarSystemModel
A quick model of a gravitating system in python. Mostly to learn Tkinter.

Begins with a large star/mass in the center and a bunch of small masses orbiting in a ring.
The ring will collapse under it's mutual gravity into a series of larger objects, with these
objects sometimes flinging each other into the central star or out into deep space. The 
user can just watch, or add in additional objects to watch how they'll affect the proccess.

Controls:
WASD or left-click and drag to move the view
Left click on world to lock the camera to that world
Mouse wheel to zoom in and out
Shift-WASD to move the view more quickly
Space to pause
+/- to speed up or slow down the simulation
Right-click and drag to add a new world (moving in the direction you dragged)
  -Scroll mouse wheel while holding right-click to change added world's size and mass
